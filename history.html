    <h1>History</h1>
        <p>The first documented Shiba to enter the US was imported by a military family in 1954.
            It is an ancient breed that has been around since 300 B.C. The breed is named after
            its history as a hunter in the rugged mountains of Japan; Shiba means "brushwood" which
            refers to their coloring and "Inu" means dog. Shibas were nearly extinct by World War II. Today 
            they are Japan's number-one companion!
