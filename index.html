<h1>Caring for A Sheeb</h1>
    <h2>Health</h2>
        <p>Most common health condition is allergies, such as skin irritation and itching.
            Most can lead normal lives with products that treat the symptoms. They don't usually manafest
            until 6 months old. Some screening recommendations:
                <ul>
                    <li>hip evaluation</li>
                    <li>ophthalmologist evaluation</li>
                    <li>patella evaluation</li>
                </ul>
        </p>
    <h2>Grooming</h2>
        <p>Shibas shed twice a year. It is important to brush or comb during these high shed times
            to reduce hair around the house. It is good at a young age to get them used to a blow dryer, brushing
            nail clipping etc. Down the road it will make it easier for a professional to do the work.
        </p>
    <h2>Exercise</h2>
        <p>Most Shibas are energetic and like to go for walks. It is important to try and take them for 
            daily walks if they don't have adaqute space in a yard. They are not super destructive when 
            left alone, but they can suffer separation anxiety.
        </p>
    <h2>Training</h2>
        <p>A Shiba can never be considered reliable off lead unless in confined area. An open dorr or unlocked
            gate could mean Shiba will be gone forever. On the positive side, a Shiba is practically
            born housebroken. Controlling bladder takes a little longer and depends a lot on immediate access
            to outdoors and diligence of owner.
        </p>
    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
        <p>They should do well on a high quality dog food with Vets approval. Some Shibas are picky and others
            will eat anything. They are prone to getting overweight so watch calorie consumption. Treat can aid
            in training, but giving too many can cause obesity. Also check what human foods are safe to feed 
            your dog!
